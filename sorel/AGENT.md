# About Sorel

## History and Positioning

SOREL was founded in 1962 by Kaufman Rubber Company (Kitchener, Ontario, Canada) as a winter footwear line designed for extremely cold and wet conditions. In 2000, Kaufman Footwear declared bankruptcy and the SOREL brand was acquired by Columbia Sportswear.

Today, SOREL positions itself as a blend of protection, functionality, and style: "premium boots ... all-season footwear." Marketing emphasizes heritage ("born in the snow", "rugged, warm, waterproof, and made to last") and a simultaneous focus on urban style.

## Specialization

SOREL focuses on footwear that provides:

- Protection from wet/snowy seasons: waterproofing and insulation
- Combination of utility and everyday style (city + nature)
- Durability and reliability: materials like leather, rubber, and solid construction
- Fashionable design: not just work boots, but shoes with designer flair

| Waterproofing                        | Many models are marked as "waterproof boots"—important for rain and moisture.                             |
| Combined materials: leather + rubber | The first SOREL winter boot—the Caribou™—combined a rugged leather upper with a handcrafted rubber shell. |
| Insulation / Cold resistance         | Winter SOREL boots use insulation, removable liners, and designs for good heat retention.                 |
| Grippy outsole                       | "Chunky lugged outsole" for wet/slippery conditions.                                                      |
| Utility and style                    | All-season footwear with a sense of design.                                                               |

Note: Not all models specify membrane names like Gore-Tex, but many are labeled waterproof and built for tough conditions.

## Why Sorel Is a Good Choice for Finland (Autumn)

- Wet climate: Sorel offers technological solutions for waterproofing.
- Good balance of urban style and real functionality. If you want boots that don't look "just for trekking" but can handle wet autumn weather, this is important.
- Many models with waterproofing and design that can handle wet asphalt, leaves, and moisture.
- Solid brand heritage adds trust.

## What to Consider When Choosing a Model

- Make sure the model is waterproof or at least water-resistant. Sorel highlights this in descriptions.
- Check the outsole: grip and tread, especially for wet leaves or early ice.
- Boot height: mid-height (ankle or slightly above) is convenient for city use; higher for nature walks.
- Insulation: for autumn, you don't need max insulation for -20°C, but light warmth and breathability are a plus.
- Materials: leather + rubber/ready shell + quality construction is better.
- Style: since you live in Finland and want boots for city wear, design matters.
