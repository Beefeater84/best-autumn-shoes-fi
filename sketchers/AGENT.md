# Skechers Brand Summary

## Overview

Skechers is the largest "duplicator" shoe brand, offering designs similar to major brands (Nike, New Balance, Hoka, Crocs, Reebok, On) at noticeably lower prices.

## Comfort & Testing

- In blind comfort tests and physical trials (drop tests, shoe dissections), Skechers often outperformed original brands—chosen 5 out of 7 times for greater softness and instant comfort.
- Skechers shoes typically have more foam, softer insoles, but use cheaper materials—often synthetic leather and less advanced soles.

## Strategy & Construction

- Skechers' main strategy is to deliver maximum comfort "from the first step," creating a strong "wow effect" in-store, even if comfort decreases after a month due to wear of cheap foam.
- Major brands also use cost-saving materials (e.g., "Duraleather" is just synthetic leather), and their advanced technologies/designs may be excessive for the average user.

## Model Comparisons

- **Skechers vs On:** Skechers are softer and more comfortable for walking; On is sportier, more stable, and durable.
- **Skechers vs New Balance:** Skechers sometimes have better uppers (real suede); New Balance is stiffer due to construction.
- **Skechers vs Crocs:** Crocs are lighter and more anatomical; Skechers are heavier, more complex, but softer in the first weeks.
- **Skechers vs Nike:** Similar construction, both use synthetic leather; Nike has slightly better materials.
- **Skechers vs Hoka:** Hoka wins in bounce and stability; Skechers excel in plush comfort but foam compresses quickly.
- **Skechers vs Reebok:** Reebok is more precise and stylish; Skechers use more synthetics but sometimes win in softness.

## Rose Anvil's Conclusion

- Skechers is not a "scam" but an honest alternative with good value for money, especially if you want instant comfort and don't care about brand prestige or longevity.
- They copy big brands in design and technology, so they look similar, but inside are often simplified.
- For durability and true quality, original brands are better, but Skechers solve the mass-market need: "affordable and pleasant on the foot right after purchase."
- For real quality, style, and lasting comfort, it's worth paying extra for originals.

**Summary:** Skechers = comfort, softness, and low price, but savings come from simple (sometimes misleading) materials; branded models = stability, style, quality, but often less comfortable "out of the box" and more expensive.
