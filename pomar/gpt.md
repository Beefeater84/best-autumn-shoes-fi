## Brand Description

Pomar is a family-owned Finnish footwear brand with over 60 years of history. The company was founded in 1960 in the town of Pomarkku by Kirsti and Toivo Leppänen, whose descendants still run the business ([m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com)). From the very beginning, Pomar focused on comfort and Scandinavian minimalism: Finnish consumers value shoes that are comfortable, practical, and elegant ([pomarshoes.com](https://pomarshoes.com)). Pomar has earned a reputation as a reliable footwear manufacturer, perfectly suited for the changing northern climate. Today, the brand is known in Finland and beyond as an expert in winter and mid-season shoes, combining tradition (family quality, hand finishing) with modern technology and sustainability ([gore-tex.com](https://gore-tex.com)).

## Specialization

Pomar specializes in urban and outdoor footwear for autumn and winter. Its niche is stylish leather boots and shoes that look like everyday footwear but have the properties of hiking shoes: waterproofing, warm lining, and anti-slip soles. Most models are designed for the Scandinavian climate—cold rains, wet snow, and frosts. Therefore, Pomar widely uses Gore-Tex membranes, natural wool and fur for insulation, and special anti-slip treads. The range includes classic Chelsea boots and city shoes, winter boots with felt lining, and some models for active recreation. Pomar remains true to its motto: "Nordic shoemakers"—creating shoes for life in northern conditions without compromising on style.

## Flagship Models

- **Pomar Neito GTX Chelsea** – Women's autumn Chelsea boots. Classic silhouette without laces, with elastic side inserts, made of genuine leather. Features a waterproof Gore-Tex membrane, keeping feet dry in the rain ([pomarshoes.com](https://pomarshoes.com)). The durable rubber sole with anti-slip tread provides stability on wet streets. Neito is one of Pomar's most popular models, combining elegance and practicality: comfortable for both city and nature in early autumn.
- **Pomar Kosmos GTX Chelsea** – Men's leather Chelsea boots for autumn. Available in classic colors (black, brown) and distinguished by a minimalist design. The Gore-Tex membrane guarantees protection from moisture and wind, which is important in rainy weather ([pomarshoes.com](https://pomarshoes.com)). Kosmos features a comfortable last and soft insole, making it suitable for long walks. The sturdy, grooved sole does not slip on wet asphalt or tiles. These boots are for those who value business style but want to be ready for any autumn weather.
- **Paljakka Extra Warm** – Boots for extreme cold. These are high, warm Pomar boots designed for winter chills down to -35 °C ([gore-tex.com](https://gore-tex.com)). The upper is made of thick genuine nubuck with water-repellent treatment; inside is dense natural fur (sheepskin) and a layer of innovative GORE-TEX ePE membrane, which is thinner and more eco-friendly than the classic version ([gore-tex.com](https://gore-tex.com)). The thick sole with deep tread remains elastic in frost and does not slip. The high shaft can be worn folded down or up—depending on snow depth and temperature. Paljakka demonstrates Pomar's commitment to innovation: it combines a modern lightweight membrane with the brand's traditional warm felt and fur.

_In addition to these models, Pomar is famous for classic lace-up boots Elisa and Luhta for women, as well as the Koli and Saana felt boot line with natural wool felt lining—they also feature Gore-Tex membranes and are suitable for wet winters._

## Key Technologies

- **GORE-TEX® Membranes** – A key advantage of Pomar. The brand was one of the first in Finland to use the legendary Gore-Tex membrane in footwear, ensuring complete waterproofing and breathability ([instagram.com](https://instagram.com)). Almost all Pomar autumn and winter models have the GTX designation, meaning protection from rain and snow. For example, Neito and Kosmos Chelsea boots use the classic 3-layer Gore-Tex membrane, which blocks moisture from outside but lets foot vapor escape. The new Paljakka model uses the innovative Gore-Tex ePE—a lighter and more eco-friendly membrane, free of PFAS ([gore-tex.com](https://gore-tex.com)). The result: Pomar shoes with Gore-Tex guarantee dry feet even in heavy autumn rain or wet snow.
- **Nordic Materials & Insulation** – Pomar actively uses materials traditional for northern footwear. For example, many winter boots have felt (wool) inserts—not only a nod to Scandinavian aesthetics but also an excellent natural insulator and moisture-wicking layer ([pomarshoes.com](https://pomarshoes.com)). The Extra Warm series uses natural fur (sheepskin) to retain heat in severe frosts ([pomarshoes.com](https://pomarshoes.com)). Leather uppers are made from premium calfskin with water-resistant treatment (oiled leather), which does not crack in frost and repels dirt and water ([gore-tex.com](https://gore-tex.com)). This combination—membrane + natural insulation + treated leather—allows Pomar shoes to withstand long wear in the cold while maintaining comfort.
- **Anti-Slip Soles** – Reliable soles are crucial for autumn in Finland. Pomar designs its soles specifically for slippery surfaces: durable thermorubber with deep tread patterns is used. Special mention goes to Pomar Spike+ technology—a flexible spiked sole for icy conditions ([ninantunnetila.fi](https://ninantunnetila.fi)). In certain models (e.g., Nuoska and Kelo winter boots), integrated metal spikes retract slightly under load, allowing safe entry into buildings ([ninantunnetila.fi](https://ninantunnetila.fi)). On ice, these spikes grip the surface firmly, preventing falls, while on hard floors, they sink in to avoid scratching. This Finnish innovation makes Pomar shoes an excellent choice for early frosts and ice at the end of autumn—you can walk confidently on icy paths without special overlays.
- **Anatomical Fit & Comfort** – Pomar pays attention to the comfort of the last for everyday wear. Many models are available in several widths (normal and XW—extra wide) to adapt to different foot shapes ([ninantunnetila.fi](https://ninantunnetila.fi)). The shoe construction uses a cushioning midsole and removable arch-support insoles to reduce foot strain during long walks. The heel often features a shock-absorbing layer (e.g., EVA foam), softening each step. Thanks to this, even heavy leather Pomar boots feel soft and do not tire the feet—an important quality for shoes designed for all-day city wear or travel.
