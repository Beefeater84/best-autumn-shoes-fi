# Halti

## Brand Description

Halti is a Finnish brand founded in 1976 by Juhani Hyökyvaara. The name comes from Halti mountain, the highest point in Finland. From the beginning, the company aimed to create gear tested in real conditions, built to last for years in the harshest expeditions. Halti quickly became known in Scandinavia for high-quality outdoor clothing and footwear, applying Scandinavian design and expertise. Finland, with its four seasons and unpredictable climate, serves as the perfect testing ground for Halti products. Today, the brand maintains its values—functionality, reliability, and respect for nature—supplying gear to both enthusiasts and professional athletes (including Finland's national ski teams).

## Specialization

Halti focuses on outdoor footwear and clothing for all weather conditions. The brand offers hiking and trekking shoes, winter boots, and everyday models designed for the changing northern climate. Special attention is paid to protection from moisture and cold: almost all Halti shoes feature proprietary waterproof membranes and insulation for the cold season. The range covers lightweight walking sneakers, mid-stiffness hiking boots, and serious winter boots—footwear for every day of autumn and winter in Finland, where rain, mud, and early frosts are common.

## Flagship Models

- **Optima 2 DrymaxX Trekking Boot**: Flagship trekking boots. High-cut, durable materials, DrymaxX membrane. Designed for long hikes, offers stability and support even on rough terrain (reinforced toe and heel, high lacing). Premium Vibram sole for reliable grip and durability. Excellent choice for late autumn—handles wet and muddy conditions, keeps feet dry.
- **Hiker Kuru Mid DrymaxX**: Versatile men's boots for short hikes and everyday use in the off-season. Mid-height upper protects the ankle from water and dirt. DrymaxX membrane ensures waterproofing and breathability. Phylon cushioned sole and wide ComfortFit last make these boots very comfortable for long walks. Durable Michelin rubber outsole with deep tread provides confident grip on wet trails.
- **Tornio DrymaxX Winterboot**: High winter boots for harsh conditions. Classic leather style, warm lining (textile fur) and Thinsulate insulation. Built-in DrymaxX waterproof membrane keeps feet dry in snow and slush. Key feature—Halti GripmaxX Arctic sole with innovative tread for maximum grip on ice and snow. Combined with Phylon midsole cushioning, Tornio boots provide stability on icy surfaces and help prevent injuries in slippery conditions.

## Key Technologies

- **DrymaxX®**: Halti's proprietary Finnish membrane, introduced in 1995. Makes footwear fully waterproof and windproof while allowing feet to breathe. Halti uses different DrymaxX levels for various conditions—from Lite (for wind and drizzle) to Ultimate (for extreme conditions). All DrymaxX products have sealed seams for guaranteed waterproofing. In Halti shoes, DrymaxX reliably protects feet from autumn rain and slush.
- **Durable non-slip soles**: Halti uses patented Michelin and Vibram soles in trekking footwear. These outsoles, made from special rubber compounds, provide excellent grip on wet and slippery surfaces and are highly wear-resistant. Winter models (e.g., Tornio) feature GripmaxX Arctic technology—special rubber and aggressive tread for traction on ice. Thus, Halti autumn shoes are stable on wet rocks and early ice.
- **Cushioning and comfort**: Most Halti boots use lightweight Phylon (a type of EVA) foam in the midsole, absorbing impact and reducing foot fatigue. Removable Ortholite® insoles with antibacterial effect conform to the foot's shape. Halti lasts are designed for northern feet—ComfortFit provides a slightly wider forefoot for comfort with warm socks and long wear.
- **Insulation and cold protection**: Autumn-winter Halti models feature modern insulation materials. For example, winter boots use Thinsulate®—a thin synthetic insulator that retains warmth even when wet. Combined with fur linings, Halti shoes can be worn in subzero temperatures typical of late autumn in Finland. Some models also have reflective elements for safety in the dark.
