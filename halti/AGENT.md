# About Halti

Halti is a Finnish brand specializing in outdoor clothing and footwear since 1976. Their products are designed for harsh and unpredictable Scandinavian weather. All shoes are built for the Finnish climate, tested in real northern nature, and made for durability and versatility.

## Purpose of Halti Footwear

Halti makes shoes for city walks, trekking, everyday use, hiking, and rough terrain. The range includes insulated waterproof shoes (DrymaxX technology), cushioned and non-slip soles (GripmaxX, Vibram®) for reliable grip, and textile/Softshell and synthetic leather for protection against rain, slush, and cold.

Urban and trekking models are often designed for temperatures from +10°C to -10°C (e.g., Halti Pale mid DX), flexible and stable for daily use, resistant to city chemicals and dirt.
