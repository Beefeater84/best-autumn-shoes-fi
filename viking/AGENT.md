# History and Positioning

Viking was founded in Norway on January 17, 1920 by entrepreneur Peter Mathias Røwde in the city of Askim.

Originally, the factory produced galoshes (rubber overshoes) to protect regular shoes from moisture and dirt.

Over time, the brand evolved to focus on footwear for outdoor activities, trekking, and harsh weather conditions—with the mission to "enable an active outdoor lifestyle." In 2020, the company celebrated its 100th anniversary, highlighting its long-standing market presence.

## Specialization

Viking specializes in footwear for outdoor activities: hiking, walking, and wet seasons. Waterproofing and weather resistance are key features. The range includes rubber boots/galoshes, walking and trekking boots, and winter options.

## Technologies and Materials

Key technical aspects of Viking footwear:

- Water-repellent / waterproof constructions (WP): Many models are marked WP (Water-Proof) or GTX (if Gore-Tex membrane is used). Examples: Viking Villrein De Luxe Tall GTX, Viking Stride Mid WP.
- Durable outsole with good grip: Essential for wet/soft ground, leaves, autumn asphalt.
- Quality upper materials: leather, combined materials, rubber protection on the lower part of the shoe.
- Designed for harsh conditions: Viking is a Norwegian brand, so many models are built for "Scandinavian" conditions.

## Why Viking Is a Good Choice for Autumn in Finland

Finland's autumn climate: frequent rain, dampness, coolness, leaves on sidewalks, possible night frosts. Footwear with waterproofing, good soles, and sturdy construction is essential.

Viking is a brand focused on these conditions—"Nordic outdoor footwear."

Model options cover the range: from "urban mid boot" to "trekking boot ready for wet forest and gravel." This gives flexibility—you can choose something universal or two pairs (city + nature).

For your lifestyle (in Finland, moving around, wanting quality), Viking offers a balance of function and reliability.

## What to Consider When Choosing Viking for Autumn

- Make sure the specific model is WP (water-proof) or GTX—otherwise, protection may be worse.
- Boot height: mid-height may be preferable in the city (less overheating, easier to wear), but if you plan walks outside the city—go for a high model.
- Outsole: choose with deep tread and good grip.
- Materials: leather + membrane or combined materials; pay attention to care (shoes should withstand dampness).
- Weight and comfort: in autumn, it's important that the boot is not too heavy, especially if part of the season will be spent in the city.
- Style: Viking is more outdoor-oriented, but there are models that look neutral enough for everyday wear. If you want maximum style, go for mid/low models.
