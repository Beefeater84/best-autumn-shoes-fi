# Nokian Footwear

## Brand Description

Nokian Jalkineet is a legendary Finnish manufacturer of rubber footwear with over 120 years of history. The brand originated from the Finnish rubber factory Suomen Gummitehdas Oy, founded in 1898 ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Later, the factory moved to the town of Nokia, where the iconic Finnish galoshes and rubber boots began production ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). For a long time, the footwear division was part of the Nokia group (yes, the same one known for phones), and it was there in the 1960s-70s that classic Nokian rubber boot models were created ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). In 1990, the company became an independent brand, Nokian Footwear, and has since focused exclusively on rubber footwear ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Today, Nokian Jalkineet is a symbol of Finnish quality and reliability: "Footwear for any weather since 1898" ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). All models are designed in Finland, with an emphasis on natural rubber blends and time-tested hand vulcanization technologies ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)).

## Specialization

Nokian Footwear specializes exclusively in rubber footwear—from lightweight galoshes and rain boots to tall hunting boots and winter felt boots with galosh. The brand is known for its iconic models: low Hai boots for yachting and everyday wear, classic tall Kontio boots for fishing and forests, and a line of professional boots for workers, foresters, etc. ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). A distinctive feature of Nokian is the use of natural rubber and traditional recipes: the boots remain elastic even in severe frost, do not crack, and last for many years ([scandinavianoutdoor.com](https://scandinavianoutdoor.com)). Nokian footwear is made for harsh northern conditions: it is resistant to dirt, marshy soil, icy water, and extreme cold. Many models are equipped with removable insulators (felt liners) and snow cuffs—essentially a multi-layer system that adapts to the season. The Nokian Footwear slogan is "Your companion in any weather," and Finns have long been convinced of this.

## Flagship Models

- **Hai** – Low rubber boots (galoshes) up to mid-calf. The Hai model was released in 1968 as footwear for sailing ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). It features a shortened silhouette and lightweight design, making it popular beyond yachts—among schoolchildren, students, and gardeners. Hai boots have cult status in Finland: bright rubber boots (especially the famous yellow and blue colors) are worn as a fashion element, combined with everyday clothing ([reddit.com](https://reddit.com)). Made from flexible natural rubber, with a textile lining inside. The textured sole prevents slipping on wet decks or asphalt. Hai is a symbol that rain and puddles can be enjoyed with the right footwear.
- **Kontio** – Classic tall rubber boots up to the knee. Kontio (Finnish for "bear") were introduced in 1973 and have since been Nokian's bestseller ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Made from multi-layer rubber (natural rubber with additives for strength), with a cotton lining. They feature a traditional design: solid colors (dark green, black, or red) with a characteristic light stripe at the top of the shaft. These boots are designed for tough conditions: dirt, swamps, deep puddles—they can handle it all. The wide shaft and adjustable strap allow pants to be tucked inside. Kontio boots are valued by hunters, fishermen, and rural residents for their durability and comfort. Even below zero, Kontio rubber remains elastic, and the tread grips the ground firmly. A winter version with a warm liner is available.
- **Finntrim** – Unique low boots for running on rough terrain and orienteering. Finntrim are ankle-high hunters, specially designed for active movement (cross-country, golf, sports orienteering) ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). They have a narrow, snug shaft with a tightening strap at the top for a secure fit ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Despite the relatively low top, these boots are fully waterproof and very lightweight. The Finntrim sole has a built-in steel shank for foot support on uneven surfaces and protection from punctures ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). The tread is a special pride of the model: it features rubber studs along the edges, acting like mini-cleats, biting into soil and wet leaves ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Moreover, if needed, metal spikes (sold separately) can be screwed into a special socket in the sole for running on ice ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Finntrim withstands frosts down to -40 °C—the rubber does not harden in the cold ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). This model demonstrates Nokian's innovative approach: combining rubber tradition and sports technology.

_In addition to those listed, Nokian has other iconic models: for example, Naali—massive winter boots with thick felt liners for ice fishing and hunting ([scandinavianoutdoor.com](https://scandinavianoutdoor.com)), or Kevyt—lightweight urban rubber ankle boots for everyday use. But Hai, Kontio, and Finntrim best reflect the spirit of the brand._

## Key Technologies

- **Natural Rubber & Handmade Production** – All Nokian boots are made from special blends, with natural rubber (from Hevea) as the base, plus additives for strength and frost resistance ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Natural rubber gives the footwear excellent elasticity and durability: boots do not crack at bends and do not harden in the cold. Key stages—cutting parts, assembling the "raw" boot on a last, and vulcanization—are traditionally done by hand by skilled craftsmen. This method ensures high quality: for example, the shaft and sole seams in Nokian boots are monolithic, without punctures, guaranteeing complete waterproofness. Nokian's motto is "Handmade rubber boots since 1898," and even in the 21st century, the brand remains true to this philosophy ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)).
- **Cold & Wear Resistance** – Nokian rubber footwear is specially made for northern climates, so materials undergo strict frost resistance tests. For example, Finntrim boots remain flexible at temperatures down to -40 °C ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Rubber blends include components that lower the glass transition temperature. Many models (Kontio, Finntrim, etc.) have soles reinforced with a steel plate (shank)—this increases torsional rigidity and protects the foot from sharp stones or ice ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). The steel heel also makes walking on rough terrain easier by distributing the load. Nokian rubber is highly abrasion-resistant: boots are designed for years of active use in mud, gravel, and other abrasive environments. They are also UV-resistant—modern additives prevent premature material aging.
- **Treads for Mud & Ice** – The sole pattern of each Nokian model is designed for specific conditions. The Haka sole on Kontio boots is well-known: large, rough tread blocks that self-clean from mud and grip slippery clay and wet grass. In winter models, Nokian uses unique solutions: for example, IceGrip—a special winter sole with fiberglass micro-spikes added to the rubber compound ([hanwag.com](https://hanwag.com)). These invisible particles act as abrasives on ice, improving traction (like sandpaper). The spiked sole Spike is another solution (e.g., in the Kevo model): integrated metal spikes for icy conditions. Finntrim features a combination: basic tread with rubber studs and the option to screw in metal spikes ([nokianfootwear.com](https://nokianfootwear.com)). Thus, Nokian footwear ensures safety on any slippery surface—from liquid mud to black ice.
- **Insulating Liners** – For the cold season, Nokian offers boots with removable inner liners. For example, the Naali model (meaning "polar fox") comes with a thick felt liner made of multi-layer wool felt ([scandinavianoutdoor.com](https://scandinavianoutdoor.com)). It is inserted into the rubber boot, providing excellent insulation and comfort during long periods standing on ice (e.g., winter fishing) ([scandinavianoutdoor.com](https://scandinavianoutdoor.com)). Felt absorbs moisture from the foot and retains heat even if condensation forms inside the boot. After use, the liner is easy to remove and dry. To retain heat in the shaft, many winter models have a tightening snow cuff (drawstring or flap) to prevent snow from entering the boot. Thanks to these solutions, Nokian keeps feet warm and dry even in the coldest days of the Finnish late autumn and winter.
